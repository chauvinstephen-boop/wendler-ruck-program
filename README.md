## Program Philosophy

### Strength Foundation
Wendler 5/3/1 provides the strength base needed to carry load efficiently over distance. The BBB volume work builds muscular endurance and work capacity.

### Progressive Overload
Ruck distance and intensity increase systematically while managing fatigue through strategic deload weeks.

### Specificity
Final weeks emphasize race-specific demands: race weight (25 lb vs training 30 lb), goal pace work, and mental preparation.

### Recovery
Built-in deload weeks, easy days, and mobility work ensure adequate recovery while maintaining fitness.

## Notes

- **Training Max**: Always use 90% of true 1RM for calculations
- **AMRAP Protocol**: On "+" sets, get as many quality reps as possible (stop 1-2 reps before failure)
- **Ruck Weight**: Train at 30 lb, race at 25 lb (regulatory minimum)
- **Pacing**: Train slightly slower than goal pace early; hit goal pace in final weeks
- **Mobility**: Include 10-20 min mobility work 3-4×/week
- **Fueling**: Test race nutrition during long rucks (weeks 3-4)
- **Equipment**: Test boots, socks, and ruck setup during training

## Adjustments

### If Training is Too Hard
- Reduce BBB volume to 3×10 or 5×5
- Lower Training Max by 5-10%
- Add extra rest days
- Reduce ruck distance by 10-20%

### If Training is Too Easy
- Increase BBB to 50-55% TM
- Add supplemental lift variations
- Increase ruck weight to 35 lb
- Add ruck+ (ruck with weight vest)

## Race Day Strategy

### Pacing
